          <hr>
          <ul>As part of the brief, we were asked to create a model or simulation that engages with a problem that is difficult to solve analytically but is amenable to solve using simulation or modelling. The learning outcomes of this Alt are: </ul>

          <h4>Project Goals:</h4>
          <hr>
          <ul>Considering the brief and current solutions I can conclude that I would like to create a model that takes in data from a user about an investment decision they are about to make. I then hope to simulate what will happen with the most accurate probability possible. This simulation is needed as a human could not write out 100,000 different investment outcomes by hand. </ul>

          <h4>After researching the brief. These are my personal goals: </h4>
          <hr>
          <li>Gain a better understanding of investment probability theory. </ul>
          <li>Create a model that will save someone time and help influence investment decision making. </ul>
