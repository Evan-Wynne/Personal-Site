        <ul>What was the outcome of your model?</ul>
        <ul>I am quite happy with the outcome of my model. I managed to create a model that takes a users specific investment needs into account and gives them tailored statistics which would in my opinion help them to make a much more informed decision with regards to long term investing. My simulation runs 100,000 times which creates an accurate overview of what investment outcome is most likely to occur. I took in the following data points from the user:</ul>
        <li>Number of years investing </li>
        <br>
        <li>Initial Investment </li>
        <br>
        <li>Monthly Investment</li>
        <br>
        <li>Expected annual return</li>
        <br>
        <li>Expected standard deviation from mean annual return</li>
        <br>
        <hr>

      </ol>
      <ol class= mb>
        <br>
        <ul>I gave the user the following Information after the 100,000 simulations had finished:</ul>
        <hr>
        <li>Returned all their previous inputted data so they can refer to it during analysis</li>
        <li>Average final value of their investment</li>
        <li>Median value of their investment out of 100,000 simulations</li>
        <li>Minimum and maximum value of their investment</li>
        <li>Standard deviation of returns</li>
        <li>Probability of losing money</li>
        <li>Mean return in Dollars and in percent</li>
        <li>A graph of the deviation between the 100,000 results</li>
        </ol>

          <h4>
            Did it act as you had planned? 
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <ul>My model did go mostly as planned but I had hoped to make it a bit more focused on one asset class. However, I would recommend that this model be used for long-term investing in index funds. </ul>
        </ol>
        <ol class= mb>

          <h4>
            Does it help solve a complex problem:
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <ul>My model solves a complex problem as simulating random investment returns each month for a set amount of years in 100,000 different instances would be impossible by hand. My model allows the user to gain insight into the probability of different investment outcomes in a graphical way with a rather user friendly interface. I would use this model for my own long term investing plans as I also found the probability of using money to be very insightful.</ul>

          <h4>
            What were its limitations? 
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <ul>The limitations of my model are that it does not tailor the investment probability to specific assets. I also think this model should have much more user input to increase accuracy of probability calculations.</ul>
        </ol>

          <h4>
            What would you do differently next time? 
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <ul>Next time I would hope to take in more user inputs and tailor the model to a more specific asset such as a stock. Here I could take in much more data about the company's financials to further increase the accuracy of output.</ul>
