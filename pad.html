          <h4>My Ideas: </h4>
          <hr>
          <li>Long term investment Simulation: <br></ul>
          <br>
          <ul><br><b>Aim: </b> &nbsp; Give a user insight into the different possible returns their investment might have and the probability of each one using standard deviation of returns. </ul>
          
          <li>Crypto Coin Investment Rating model: <br></ul>
            <br>
            <ul><br><b>Aim: </b> &nbsp; Give user insight into the possible returns of a cryptocurrency investment, through looking at coin metrics known as ‘tokenomics’. </ul>
          <li>Venture Capital startup Investment Rating model:<br></ul>
            <br>
            <ul><br><b>Aim: </b> &nbsp; To allow Venture Capitalists to screen a startup through calculating their success probability before they agree to engage in a meeting/pitch.   </ul>
          <li>Investment Property Future Cashflow Model: <br></ul>
          
            <br>
          <ul><br><b>Aim: </b> &nbsp; To allow landlords to calculate probability of different  returns of an investment property in different economic climates.</ul>
          <hr>
          <ul>I then narrowed it down to 4 different types of probability simulations and scored each model on 5 different factors in a scoring matrix. </ul>
          <h4>Idea Scoring Matrix:</h4>
          <hr>
          <img src="matrix.png" class = 'ima'>
          <ul>From my above scoring matrix. I have chosen the investment simulation model over my other ideas for a few reasons; I find it most interesting. I also feel I can complete it in the given timeframe and be able to code it without extreme difficulty, but it should still challenge me. I also felt myself and others could find use in my model  </ul>
          
          </ol>
          <ol class = mb>
            <h4>My Timeline (Plan): </h4>
            <hr>
            <ul>I chose a waterfall design approach because I want to have concrete documentation at the end of each stage of my project to prevent many adjustments at a later stage. This can be seen in the below design plan. </ul>

          </ol>      
          <ol class = mb>
            <h4>Flowcharts: </h4>
            <hr>
            <ul>I made a flowchart of my system architecture and an additional flowchart on one of my two functions. The reason I don't feel like I need a flowchart for my second function(Statistics calculator) is because of how straightforward it is. I will simply create statistics from my data using different statistics modules from the imported statistics python package. I chose to use modular programming for this model; I will break down processes into separate functions. </ul>
